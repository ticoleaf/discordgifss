# My Discord Gifs

Yes I only made a github account for this.
Discord deletes my gifs after like 2 months even if i use them so i host them here

Just incase someone actually does this and wonders what i do with these ( understandably weird ) gifs

I just use them to troll honestly, i havent bullied or harmed anyone with it and all fo them are photoshopped by me in my free time or edited youtube thumbnails ( speech bubble, changed text, etc. )
